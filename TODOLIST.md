# ToDo list

 * garbage collection process for non existing item (type,id)
 * garbage collection process should be documented as it needs to be run manually by user
 * render collection should index on (type,id,style) instead of (type,id)
 * implement a renderAll() for rendering multiple containers at once which allow global preload
 * implement a generic controller with ajax operations and security/consistency checks
